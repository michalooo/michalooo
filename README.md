First bigger project

My first major project was participation in the 24-

hour "MGA game jam" which took place in Opole i

November 2018, together with my friends we

created a game that can be downloaded on

computer [**~~here~~**](https://itch.io/jam/mga-game-jam-2018/rate/325747)

The event was also commented on

on [**~~TV~~**](https://opole.tvp.pl/39782188/musieli-stworzyc-gre-w-24-godziny-zespolowy-game-jam-na-politechnice-opolskiej):





Main goal

Our main goal in the game is to destroy the

mannequins with the weapons that we have from

the beginning or have to find in the game. The

mannequins move towards us when we do not

look at them, if they come into contact with us

the game is over, but if we defeat them then we

move to the next level





Things I learned while creating this gam

Manipulating lighting in the game

Modeling of 3D models

Using Raycasting when using weapons

Moving in a 3D game as well as detecting wh

look at an object and automatically moving to

the selected object









First professional game

Spaco was my first game that I was able to release with my f

on Android devices

This project taught me a lot because we had to go through a

stages of creating the game, from creating the idea and mech

of the game, through creating graphics and selecting music, t

final release of the game on the Google Play store [**~~here~~**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unity3d.Spaco&hl=pl&gl=US)

actually working products that can be used by other people
